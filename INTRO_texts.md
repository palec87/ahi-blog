## Welcome to Algarve Human Intelligence â€“ Your Contributions Matter
This blog is built to encourage cross-community collaboration, so **self-promotion is not just allowed â€“ itâ€™s encouraged!** Link to your personal website, GitHub repositories, research, or community initiatives. Share what youâ€™re building, learning, or struggling with. Letâ€™s make open-source work visible!

As an author you are also encouraged to write a short bio about yourself including all contacts to facilitate collaboration.

### Requirements
There are no strict topic limits! However, your posts should focus on **practical, useful, or exploratory** topics in open-source digital knowledge space.

The only requirements are in place to keep the blogging smooth and at the same time keep high standards high to be relevant to the community.
- Your post is based on a project with code or a digital product in a **public repository**.
- Your repository is **Runnable** or explains the creative process with clear setup instructions.
- The work is under a **permissive license** (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) so others can build on it.
- Suggest reviewers to proofread your post and confirm the functionality of the codebase as  described in the blog post.

### How to get started
- **Write your post** following the AHI template (this file!).
- **Submit your draft** via email, Google Forms (DP: I build only upon finalized template file), or share a link to your repository containing the `.md` file with the post.
- **Engage with the community!** Reply to comments (DP: not sure we will have comments section), suggest improvements, and connect with contributors.
